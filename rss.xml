            <description><![CDATA[<p>On January 10th 2016 a new post caught my eye. It was about the discovery of the genetic switches that underlie intelligence. The mnemonic reflex was automatic and I found myself wandering in the world of the 1960 and 1966 award-winning science fiction novel "Flowers for Algernon"; a story about a mouse (and a man) that got its intelligence increased artificially. With genetic engineering surfing the wave of Â a new revolution in the field of molecular biology, it is not a quantum leap to believe (with fear and hope and all the mixed feelings that come with such a thought) that the novel may become true - soon. This site is dedicated to the attempt to imagine how "Flowers for Algenon" would be like today, at the dawn of 2016.</p>]]></description>
