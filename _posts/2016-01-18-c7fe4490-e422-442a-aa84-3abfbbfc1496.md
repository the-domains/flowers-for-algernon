On January 10th 2016 a new post caught my eye. It was about the discovery of the genetic switches that underlie intelligence. The mnemonic reflex was automatic and I found myself wandering in the world of the 1960 and 1966 award-winning science fiction novel "Flowers for Algernon"; a story about a mouse (and a man) that got its intelligence increased artificially. With genetic engineering surfing the wave of  a new revolution in the field of molecular biology, it is not a quantum leap to believe (with fear and hope and all the mixed feelings that come with such a thought) that the novel may become true - soon. This site is dedicated to the attempt to imagine how "Flowers for Algenon" would be like today, at the dawn of 2016\. Enjoy. Or Not - I've tried my best to be scientifically sound, but I might not have been at times. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2a8a7aa0-804f-4b3e-870d-3f01000b728b.jpg)
